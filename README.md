# **Dynamic Interview Slot Generator (Django)**

## üóÇÔ∏è Overview

IImplement a backend feature for a scheduling tool. The goal is to **dynamically generate potential interview time slots** by intersecting the real-time availability of multiple interviewers.

Unlike systems with static slots, this exercise simulates a more realistic setup ‚Äî pulling external calendar data, evaluating overlapping availability, and applying constraints.

---

## üéØ Goal

Build an API that, given an interview template ID, returns potential time slots where **all assigned interviewers are available at the same time** for the required duration.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

You must use:

- Python 3.10+
- Django 4.x
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Faker (already used in provided helper)

---

## üìã Core Requirements

### ‚úÖ Models

You'll need to implement models to support this feature. At a minimum:

- `Interviewer`: represents someone who conducts interviews
- `InterviewTemplate`: represents a type of interview, with:
    - A name (e.g., "Technical Interview")
    - A duration in minutes (e.g., 60)
    - A many-to-many relationship to Interviewers

You're free to design additional models if it helps with clarity or flexibility.

---

### ‚úÖ Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/interviews/<id>/availability
```

This endpoint should:

1. Load the `InterviewTemplate` with the given ID
2. Use the **provided mock service** to fetch availability for all associated interviewers
3. Return **only time slots where all interviewers are simultaneously available** for the required duration
4. Format the result as a JSON response

---

## üßæ Interviewer Availability Service

To simulate the external calendar system, use the helper in:

```
service/mock_availability.py
```

Import and call the function like so:

```python
from service.mock_availability import get_free_busy_data

interviewer_ids = [1, 2]
busy_data = get_free_busy_data(interviewer_ids)

```

### üîÑ Sample Output

```json
[
  {
    "interviewerId": 1,
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "busy": [
      { "start": "2025-01-22T09:00:00Z", "end": "2025-01-22T12:00:00Z" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "interviewerId": 2,
    "name": "Bob Smith",
    "busy": [
      { "start": "2025-01-22T10:00:00Z", "end": "2025-01-22T13:00:00Z" }
    ]
  }
]
```

> ‚úÖ You are welcome to enhance or modify this service as needed ‚Äî e.g., to support filtering, partial day simulation, or sorting.

## üì§ API Response Format

```json
{
  "interviewId": 1,
  "name": "Technical Interview",
  "durationMinutes": 60,
  "interviewers": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Alice Johnson" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bob Smith" }
  ],
  "availableSlots": [
    {
      "start": "2025-01-22T10:00:00Z",
      "end": "2025-01-22T11:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "start": "2025-01-22T11:00:00Z",
      "end": "2025-01-22T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints

You must enforce the following:

- Slots must be **exactly** the duration minutes of the template
- Slots must begin on **hour or half-hour marks** (e.g., 10:00, 10:30)
- **All interviewers must be available** for the full slot duration
- **No slot may begin less than 24 hours** in the future
- All times must be in **UTC** in ISO 8601 format

---

### üß† Developer Insight (Required)

In addition to meeting the requirements above, we'd like you to demonstrate how you think beyond the surface.

### ‚úÖ What to Do:

As part of your submission, please identify **one unique edge case or complexity** you encountered that wasn't explicitly mentioned in the prompt.

- This could relate to availability overlaps, data inconsistencies, ambiguous logic, or system design.
- Implement your handling of it in the code.
- Add a short explanation in your README:
    - What the case was
    - Why it mattered
    - How you handled it

### üí° Why:

In real-world systems, requirements evolve and edge cases emerge. We want to see how you anticipate and reason about those situations ‚Äî not just follow a spec.

---

## üì¶ Submission

Submit a GitHub repo with:

- All source code
- Your own models, views, serializers
- README with:
    - Setup instructions
    - Design decisions
    - Your extra edge case write-up

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

This project includes Docker configuration for easy setup and consistent environments.

1. **Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system**

2. **Build and start the application**
   ```bash
   # Build and start all services
   make up
   
   # Or alternatively
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   make migrate
   
   # Or alternatively
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Create a superuser (optional)**
   ```bash
   make superuser
   
   # Or alternatively
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Load sample data (optional)**
   ```bash
   make loaddata
   
   # Or alternatively
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py loaddata sample_data
   ```

6. **Access the API**
   
   The API will be available at: http://localhost:8000/api/interviews/<id>/availability

### Other Useful Commands

```bash
# View logs
make logs

# Run tests
make test

# Stop all containers
